              <h2>Free Style</h2>
             <p>Freestyle involves alternating arms that make windmill arc motions forward while the head is underwater, and the swimmer breathes at the side. It is accompanied by a two or six beat flutter kick that is synced with arm strokes to stabilize the body.</p>

            <h2>Breast stroke</h2>
            <p>The breaststroke is a fun and easy-to-learn swimming technique. Swimming breaststroke is a great form of exercise that engages the arms, legs, shoulders, and neck. There are basically three simple motions. First, kick your legs behind you. Then you just glide for a bit and pull yourself forward with your arms. With some practice, you’ll be swimming the breaststroke in no time.</p>

             <h2>Backstroke</h2>
             <p>The backstroke technique, which is also referred to as the back crawl, is one of the competitive swimming strokes. When trying backstroke, the swimmer floats face-up in the water, kicks their legs continuously in a flutter kick while moving their arms asynchronously.</p>

            <h2>Butterfly</h2>
            <p>The butterfly stroke is a technique where you use both your arms and legs to create a dolphin-like motion through the water, resulting in a beautiful wave-like effect. It’s a stunning stroke, but quite difficult to master.</p>
